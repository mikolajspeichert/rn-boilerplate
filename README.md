### React Native  boilerplate
Welcome to my boilerplate - small piece of React Native code with dependencies I consider important installed. Based on `react-native init`.

Dependencies:

- [Redux](http://redux.js.org)
- [dotenv](https://github.com/zetachang/react-native-dotenv)
- [React navigation](https://reactnavigation.org)
- [i18n](https://github.com/AlexanderZaytsev/react-native-i18n)
- [eslint](https://eslint.org)
- [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-uuid)

## Quick start

1. Clone using `git clone https://github.com/mikolajspeichert/rn-boilerplate boilerplate`
2. `cd boilerplate`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run tests using `npm run test`
5. To run on device emulators, you have to have installed `react-native` npm module, then run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`. See more on [React Native getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

> This project is still in development, please inform about any issues

> As soon as react 16.0.0 reaches rc/stable version, tests will be upgraded to [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
